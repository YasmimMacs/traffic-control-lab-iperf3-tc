## Overview
This portfolio demonstrates how I measured baseline network throughput and then applied Linux Traffic Control (tc) to simulate congestion and network impairment (rate limiting, delay/jitter, packet loss). Evidence includes iperf3 tests, ping results, and tc/qdisc configurations.

## Tools Used
- Ubuntu (UTM VMs)
- iperf3 (throughput testing)
- tc / qdisc (traffic shaping & impairment)
- ping, ss/systemctl (verification)

## Topology
- LAN Server VM (iperf3 server)
- LAN Client VM (iperf3 client)
- NAT/bridged LAN segment within UTM

## Evidence
- Network 1: baseline → shaping → verify → rollback
- Network 2: baseline → netem impairment → verify → rollback

## Key Results (summary)
- Baseline: multi-Gbps throughput in lab LAN
- With controls: throughput reduced and latency increased as configured
- Controls were reversible (tc qdisc del/replace) to restore baseline performance
